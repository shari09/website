  description: `
    I mainly do programming in the web development field which includes both frontend programming and writing APIs. 
    Just as a disclaimer, I'm not just a lowly web-dev, I can also write low level code such as 
    implementing event listeners, thread pools, working with sockets, or optimizing memory and speed.
    
    Aside from programming, I'm actually fascinated in the category of artsâ€”literature, visual arts and music, but I'm not an expert in either fields.
    However, during the creation of this website, I have two very proud moments. 
    One being when a friend asked me if I stole the design and forked a repo
    and another when someone asked where I got the "Engineering is the process..." quote from, and I surprised them by saying that I designed
    and came up with everything myself including the quote.
