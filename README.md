# Personal Website v2

As co-op hunting season is coming close, I finally found the urge to remake my personal website (don't worry about v1) so it'll be an actual presentable website.

> "Was this forked?"

Nope, but I'll take that as a compliment :))

I designed and coded everything by my own without copying any designs/templates ğŸ˜„
